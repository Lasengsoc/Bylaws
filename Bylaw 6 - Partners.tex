&& Purpose and Principles
    &&& The purpose of this bylaw is to describe the procedure by which Student Organizations and Professional Organizations can partner with the Lassonde Engineering Society and outline the procedures and details of that partnership.
    &&& The views of a Partner Organization do not necessarily reflect the views of LES. No Partner Organization may claim to speak on behalf of the Society.
&& Interpretations and Definitions
    &&& In any situations where this Bylaw contradicts Bylaw 1, Bylaw 1 shall have precedence.
    &&& In this document:
        &&&& Lassonde Engineering Society shall be referred to as “LES”;
        &&&& The LES Board of Directors will be referred to as “BOD”;
        &&&& Student Executive Partner shall be referred to as “SEP”;
        &&&& Student Associate Partner shall be referred to as “SAP”;
        &&&& Professional Partner Organization shall be referred to as “PPO”;
        &&&& A motion that is presented at a BOD meeting for the purpose of creating a partnership with an organization shall be referred to as “Motion of Partnership”;
        &&&& A motion that is presented at a BOD meeting for the purpose of renewing a previously created partnership with an organization shall be referred to as “Motion of Partnership Renewal” ;
        &&&& A motion that is presented at a BOD meeting for the purpose of dissolving a partnership with an Organization shall be referred to to as a “Motion of Partnership Dissolution”;
